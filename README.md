Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a Python-based attendance system that utilizes face recognition technology. The machine learning model captures 50 frames of the user's face during enrollment and subsequently uses these images for user recognition. It incorporates libraries such as cv2 and os for face recognition, datetime for date and time management, and sklearn, numpy, and pandas for data processing.
